The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna. Speaking during a joint press conference in Berlin with her German counterpart, Colonna stressed the need "to strengthen our support to Ukraine.
Despite opposition from countries like Hungary, Colonna said she is "optimistic" that the package will be approved and commended the "remarkable" unity shown by the EU in holding Russia accountable.
We have to continue because it is this unity that is our strength," Colonna emphasized. 
Between December 2021 and March 2022, the WFP said that, according to recent surveys conducted by the organization, the number of people suffering due to severe food insecurity вЂњshot upвЂќ by more than 500,000. Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports. It added that Caribbean nations that import substantial amounts of food will be particularly affected due to вЂњsoaringвЂќ sea freight costs.
Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.
She handed back the ring, and a graver expres- sion passed over her mobile face.
"I feel as you said in your letter, Frank. There is something tragic in it. It will be with me forever. All the future will arrange itself round that little ring.''
"Are you afraid of it?''
"Afraid ! " Her gray glove rested for an in- stant upon the back of his hand. " I couldnH be afraid of anything if you were with me. It is really extraordinary, for by nature I am* so easily frightened. But if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be just the same. You see, I become for the time part of you, as it were, and you are brave enough for two."
"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor. You imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things, while I Tcnow that I am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no more worthy of you than — well, than any one else is."
They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up. To both of them silence was prefer- able to small talk.
" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen
the Australians, have you? " 
" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands. The sun had gone, a ragged, slate- coloured cloud was drifting up from over the river, and the rain was falling with a soft per- sistency which is more fatal than the most bois- terous shower. There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.

Between December 2021 and March 2022, the WFP said that, according to recent surveys conducted by the organization, the number of people suffering due to severe food insecurity вЂњshot upвЂќ by more than 500,000. Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports. It added that Caribbean nations that import substantial amounts of food will be particularly affected due to вЂњsoaringвЂќ sea freight costs.
Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

"I feel as you said in your letter, Frank. There is something tragic in it. It will be with me forever. All the future will arrange itself round that little ring.''
"Are you afraid of it?''
"Afraid ! " Her gray glove rested for an in- stant upon the back of his hand. " I couldnH be afraid of anything if you were with me. It is really extraordinary, for by nature I am* so easily frightened. But if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be just the same. You see, I become for the time part of you, as it were, and you are brave enough for two."
"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor. You imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things, while I Tcnow that I am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no more worthy of you than — well, than any one else is."
They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up. To both of them silence was prefer- able to small talk.
" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen
the Australians, have you? " 
" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands.

There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

"I feel as you said in your letter, Frank. There is something tragic in it. It will be with me forever. All the future will arrange itself round that little ring.''
"Are you afraid of it?''
"Afraid ! " Her gray glove rested for an in- stant upon the back of his hand. " I couldnH be afraid of anything if you were with me. It is really extraordinary, for by nature I am* so easily frightened. But if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be just the same. You see, I become for the time part of you, as it were, and you are brave enough for two."
"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up.

Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest.

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

It added that Caribbean nations that import substantial amounts of food will be particularly affected due to вЂњsoaringвЂќ sea freight costs.
Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.
She handed back the ring, and a graver expres- sion passed over her mobile face.
"I feel as you said in your letter, Frank. There is something tragic in it. It will be with me forever. All the future will arrange itself round that little ring.''
"Are you afraid of it?''
"Afraid ! " Her gray glove rested for an in- stant upon the back of his hand. " I couldnH be afraid of anything if you were with me. It is really extraordinary, for by nature I am* so easily frightened. But if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be just the same. You see, I become for the time part of you, as it were, and you are brave enough for two."
"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor. You imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things, while I Tcnow that I am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no more worthy of you than — well, than any one else is."
They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up. To both of them silence was prefer- able to small talk.
" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen
the Australians, have you? " 
" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands. The sun had gone, a ragged, slate- coloured cloud was drifting up from over the river, and the rain was falling with a soft per- sistency which is more fatal than the most bois- terous shower. There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

"I feel as you said in your letter, Frank. There is something tragic in it. It will be with me forever. All the future will arrange itself round that little ring.''
"Are you afraid of it?''
"Afraid ! " Her gray glove rested for an in- stant upon the back of his hand. " I couldnH be afraid of anything if you were with me. It is really extraordinary, for by nature I am* so easily frightened. But if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be just the same. You see, I become for the time part of you, as it were, and you are brave enough for two."
"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor. You imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things, while I Tcnow that I am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no more worthy of you than — well, than any one else is."
They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up. To both of them silence was prefer- able to small talk.
" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen

" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands.

There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

She handed back the ring, and a graver expres- sion passed over her mobile face.
"I feel as you said in your letter, Frank. There is something tragic in it. It will be with me forever. All the future will arrange itself round that little ring.''
"Are you afraid of it?''
"Afraid ! " Her gray glove rested for an in- stant upon the back of his hand. " I couldnH be afraid of anything if you were with me. It is really extraordinary, for by nature I am* so easily frightened. But if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be just the same. You see, I become for the time part of you, as it were, and you are brave enough for two."
"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor. You imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things, while I Tcnow that I am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no more worthy of you than — well, than any one else is."
They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up. To both of them silence was prefer- able to small talk.
" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen
the Australians, have you? " 
" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands. The sun had gone, a ragged, slate- coloured cloud was drifting up from over the river, and the rain was falling with a soft per- sistency which is more fatal than the most bois- terous shower. There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

"Afraid ! " Her gray glove rested for an in- stant upon the back of his hand. " I couldnH be afraid of anything if you were with me. It is really extraordinary, for by nature I am* so easily frightened. But if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be just the same. You see, I become for the time part of you, as it were, and you are brave enough for two."
"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor. You imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things, while I Tcnow that I am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no more worthy of you than — well, than any one else is."
They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up. To both of them silence was prefer- able to small talk.
" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen
the Australians, have you? " 
" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands.

There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

"I don't profess to be so brave as all that," said Frank. " I expect I have as many nerves as my neighbours."
Maude's gray toque nodded up and down. " I know all about that," said she.
"You have such a false idea of me. It makes me happy at the time and miserable afterward, for I feel such a rank impostor. You imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things, while I Tcnow that I am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no more worthy of you than — well, than any one else is."
They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up.

Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen

" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future.

" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen
the Australians, have you? " 
" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands.

There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy.

And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.The European Union needs to adopt its sixth package of sanctions against Russia soon, according to France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet.

" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "

These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance.

The WFP said the war in Ukraine has led to a surge in commodity and energy prices, which is leading to a rise in food inflation that threatens the region since several countries are highly dependent on cereal imports.

Since the war began, Russia has been blocking Ukraine from exporting goods from its ports, fueling fears of a global food crisis. 
Russia has blocked almost all ports and all, so to speak, maritime opportunities to export food вЂ” our grain, barley, sunflower and more," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.

They had discussed the rooms in their new house, and the bridesmaid's dresses, and Maude's cooking, and marriage presents, and the merits of Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude was the lady champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and the destiny of the universe — to say nothing of a small bottle of Per- rier Jouet. It was reprehensibly extravagant, but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future. Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked freely and with pleasure. Frank never made the common mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by eager- ly keeping up. To both of them silence was prefer- able to small talk.
" We'll just get down there after lunch," said
Frank, as he paid his bill. '' You have not seen
the Australians, have you? " 
" But this is a new lot. There are nine of the present team who have never played in England before."
" They are very good, are they not? "
" Very good, indeed. And the dry summer has helped them. It is the sticky English wickets which put them off. The wickets are very fast over there. Giffen is their best all-round man, but Darling and Indale and young Hill are good enough for anything. Well, then — O Lord! what a pity! "
He had turned toward the window as he rose, and saw one of those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands. The sun had gone, a ragged, slate- coloured cloud was drifting up from over the river, and the rain was falling with a soft per- sistency which is more fatal than the most bois- terous shower. There would be no more cricket that day.
Then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselves — a part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen. Frank tried to quote the passage in which Macau- lay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring Parliament Hall, and coming hither for peace and rest. Here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes fool- ishly, but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the wind — Canning and Peel, Pitt, Fox, Grattan, and Beaconsfield. Governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls. Bea- consfield alone among them all showed the hard- lined face of the self-made man. These others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realize how strong they were, but they sprang from those rul- ing castes to whom strength came by easy inherit- ance. Frank told Maude the little which he knew about each of them — of Grattan, the noblest Irish- man of them all; of Castlereagh, whose cofiin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob, who wished to tear out his corpse; of Fox, the lib- ertine philosopher ; of Palmerston, the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk.Thej marvelled at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the small-pox, and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad Eobert Peel in a Roman toga.
Then turning to the right at the end of the statesmen's transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave. It was overwhelming, the grand- eur of the roof above and of the contents below. Any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all? Here was Darwin, who revolutionized zoology; and here was Isaac Newton, who gave a new direction to astron- omy. Here were old Ben Jonson; and Stephenson, the father of railways ; and Livingstone, of Africa ; and Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold. Here were the good Shaftesbury and soldiers of the mutiny, Clyde and Outram and Lawrence, and painters and authors and surgeons, and all the good sons who in their several degree had done loyal service to the old mother. And when their service was done, the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home, and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her children loving and true.
